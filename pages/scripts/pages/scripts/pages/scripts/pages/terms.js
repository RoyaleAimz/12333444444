      <h1>VantaScripts Terms of Service</h1>
      <p><em>Last updated: May 16, 2025</em></p>

      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By accessing or using the VantaScripts website, products, or services (collectively, the “Site”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please stop using the Site immediately. VantaScripts reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate access to the Site or any services at its sole discretion.
      </p>

      <h2>2. User Representations & Account</h2>
      <p>By using the Site, you represent and warrant that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All registration and payment information you provide is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.</li>
        <li>You are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence, or you have obtained parental permission to use the Site.</li>
        <li>You will not access the Site through automated or non-human means (e.g., bots or scripts).</li>
        <li>You will not use the Site for any illegal or unauthorized purpose or in violation of any applicable law or regulation.</li>
        <li>If any information you provide is false, inaccurate, or incomplete, VantaScripts may suspend or terminate your account without liability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Product Access & Licensing</h2>
      <p>
        Access to scripts is granted by a license key or user account obtained through purchase. Delivery may be instantaneous or emailed to you within 24 hours of purchase. Each license key is valid for one user on one computer. If you change computers, contact support for review and re-activation. VantaScripts reserves the right to deactivate or delete accounts for reasons including, but not limited to, account sharing, fraudulent activity, or violation of community guidelines.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Purchases & Payments</h2>
      <p>
        All purchases are processed in U.S. dollars. You agree to provide current, complete, and accurate billing information. VantaScripts may correct pricing errors, refuse or cancel orders at its discretion, including orders from the same account, payment method, or shipping address. Unauthorized or fraudulent payments, or attempts to charge back payments, will result in account disablement and potential legal action.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Because our products are digital, we do not offer refunds for reasons of change of mind or partial usage. However, if a script fails to function as described or if we make an error on our end, you are eligible for a full refund upon verification of the issue.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Cancellation</h2>
      <p>
        You may cancel any pending order that has not yet been delivered. Once delivered, cancellations are handled under the Refund Policy.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Downtime & Compensation</h2>
      <p>
        While we strive for continuous availability, VantaScripts does not guarantee uninterrupted access. We are not liable for downtime or losses resulting therefrom.
      </p>

      <h2>8. End-User License Agreement (EULA)</h2>
      <p>
        The EULA governs your rights to use the software provided by VantaScripts. By downloading or installing any script, you agree to be bound by the EULA’s terms. All intellectual property rights in the software remain with VantaScripts or its licensors. You receive a revocable, non-exclusive license to use the software solely for personal, non-commercial use. You may not reverse-engineer, decompile, translate, adapt, or create derivative works from the software. Any breach will result in immediate revocation of your license without notice.
      </p>

      <h2>9. General Terms</h2>
      <p>
        VantaScripts may update these Terms of Service at any time, with changes effective upon posting. Continued use of the Site signifies acceptance of the revised terms. If any provision of these terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Disclaimer of Warranties & Liability</h2>
      <p>
        The Site and all products are provided “as is” and “as available,” without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. VantaScripts disclaims all liability for any damages arising from the use or inability to use the Site or products, including lost data, lost profits, or business interruption.
